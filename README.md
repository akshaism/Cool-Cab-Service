Pool Cab Service for Groceries and Metro City Ride

Centralized car pool service for rides to nearest groceries stores in the user chosen location area.
This webapp is inspired from college student's needs. One of the most important is the commute to nearest groceries and metro cities where public transport has always been an issue which has motivated such services for student's advantage.

We propose a Cab pooling service for finding, scheduling cabs and incentivizing the users involved in the network.
